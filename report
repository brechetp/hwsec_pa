The traces provided by the attack are not clear, and the attack fails. We observe spikes in several different clock cycles (we should only see them around the 24th cc corresponding to 8 (input) + 16 (rounds)

The attack fails for three main reasons:
1. The signal/noise ratio is fairly poor
2. We attack one bit at a time (while 6-bit subkeys generate 4 bits)
3. The statistical tool used is not the best one (PCC?)

We will try to improve these points

1. Improve the signal strenght

The attack is done on register LR. We partition traces according to the value of the bit #b (provided as an argument) during the last round (#16).
The red trace we have (supposely corresponding to the good one) is not that clear, we have spikes elsewhere (consider keeping the spike occuring during CC # 8+15=23 ?).
The signal/noise ratio is really poor, this is due to the strength of the signal we consider.

By partitioning by the bit value (0 or 1), we face two options with poor resolution.

Case 0: differential average power consumption = 50% * 0->0 + 50% * 1->0 = (I(falling) + I(static)) / 2
Case 1: 50% * 0->1 + 50% 1->1  = (I(rising) + I(static)) / 2

Since we substract the to partition average traces, our signal is worth (I(rising) - I(falling)) / 2

If, instead, we partition traces according to "there has been a transition" and "there has not been a transition" (between r14 and r15),  the two cases have the following signal strength:

Case transition : 50% * 1->0 + 50% * 1->0  = (I(rising) + I(static)) / 2 + (I(falling) + I(static)) / 2
Case no transition : 0

So, our signal is now worth (I(rising) + I(falling)) / 2 + I(static) >> (I(rising) - I(falling)) / 2 -- even if I(static) were negligeable

To implement this improvement, we only need to change our partitioning : in the decision table making, we focus on transition (r14 xor r15) regarding the attacked bit (target_bit).

The attack now works (i.e a single subkey is returned by SBox).


2. 4-bit attack

We want to take advantage of the whole information a 6-bit subkey guess provides, i.e. use the 4 bits of the
